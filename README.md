# kraken-gaza-batrachomyomachia

Theodorus Gazaâ€™s prose paraphrase of the *Batrachomyomachia*.

Started from the initial OCR results of [`kraken-gaza-iliad`](https://github.com/ryanfb/kraken-gaza-iliad). Since the *Batrachomyomachia* is a shorter work included in those volumes, I decided to split it off and correct it first as an experiment in seeing how the quality was and to get a finished corrected short work out the door.

OCR is being manually corrected in the individual `.txt` files in the `nfc` folder, which are then automatically assembled together by scripts into complete texts:
